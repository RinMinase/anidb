# ANIDB Code of Conduct
All visitors, members, and coordinators ("participants") of this project are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. I expect cooperation from everyone to ensure a safe environment.

### The Quick Version
This project is dedicated to provide a harassmentÂ­free experience for everyone, and we do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. I ask you to be considerate of others and behave professionally and respectfully to all other participants. This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues (online, in-person as well as in all one-on-one communications), and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members. Contributors are subject to these guidelines and the Code of Conduct.

Diversity and inclusion make this community strong. I encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.

My goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other protected categories under applicable law.
